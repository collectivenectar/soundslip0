# soundslip - 0(v0)
An audio NFT platform for artists and fans

# Current State:

This is in research and planning phase, with a focus on getting to stage 1 of 5 stages
as an MVP (Minimum viable product). 

*Current Task* as of 06/04/24

Tech Stack Research



Being heavily dependent on the chia blockchain, which
would normally require a private node, I'm starting out by building on mintgardens API,
to familiarize myself with the requirements and get up to speed quickly.

If you have any suggestions feel free to reach out!
